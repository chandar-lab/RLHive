Environments
==================

Installing Environments
------------------------
We support several environments in RLHive, namely:

* Atari
* Gym classic control
* Minatar (simplified Atari)
* Minigrid (single-agent grid world)
* Marlgrid (multi-agent)
* Pettingzoo (multi-agent)

While gym comes installed with the base package, for the other environments, you need
to install them. See :ref:`Installation <installation>`.
